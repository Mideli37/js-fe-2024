Hello! My name is Nastia, and today I want to share with you the story of my journey into the world of development.

I'm 22 years old. Currently, I'm studying at Kyiv Medical University and taking RS school Front-End course
I have the ability to learn quickly and adapt to new technologies, which allows me to successfully complete tasks.
My communication skills and ability to work in a team help me to interact with colleagues, share ideas, and find optimal solutions. I strive for continuous learning by constantly exploring new technologies. My responsibility and determination help me to achieve my goals.

This journey began in March 2022 when I started learning Python from the book by Eric Matthes. I solved simple problems on codewars and tasks from the book

After that, I got interested in other programming languages: what their special features are, and what they are used for. JavaScript and web development caught my attention, and I realized that it's the direction that appeals to me.

Studying Python and solving small tasks helped me learn the basic principles of programming and logic, which turned out to be important and very useful in further learning.

Throughout my education, I've worked on various projects, including Coffee House, Hangman, and Nonograms.

Coffee House: This project involved creating a responsive website with two pages and adding interactivity to them. I learned how to create an auto-scrolling slider and improved my skills in working with modal windows.

Hangman: A classic word game where the goal is to find the correct word by guessing letters one at a time. That was my first project, where user constantly interacts with application.

Nonograms: This was an unusually big project for me, with complex logic and interactions between modules such as field cells, modal windows, timers, and game control buttons. I enjoyed exploring a new features and adapting them to my needs.

Completing these projects has provided me with numerous valuable skills, such as splitting code into logical parts using classes, working with events, using CSS modules, and Webpack. It significantly boosted my confidence in utilizing classes and their advantages.Not only did I sharpen my technical skills, but I discovered my ability to solve complex problems and tackle new challenges.

Looking ahead, I am eager to continue my journey, delving deeper into the world of front-end development.
Thank you for your the attention! Bye!
